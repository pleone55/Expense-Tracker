# Expense-Tracker

Simple expense tracker allowing you to add either income or other expenses. If the expense is something you had to spend money on, it is identified by a red marker and a (-) sign. 
If it is positive income, it is marked by a green marker and a (+) sign. The total, income and expenses is calculated at the top. The total balance of both is tracked and updated 
based upon adding new items to the list or removing items from the list.
